# Housing Price EDA and Hypothesis Testing

This project explores a housing dataset through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing to understand factors influencing house sale prices. The analysis includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques, with a focus on engineered features like the interaction between overall quality and living area (`qual_living_area_interaction`).

## Project Highlights

- Descriptive statistics and visualizations for key numerical and categorical features  
- Investigation of relationships between house characteristics and sale price  
- Hypothesis formulation and statistical testing (ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis) on engineered features  
- Insights into feature importance and potential for future modeling  

## Key Features Analysed

- Overall quality and living area interaction (`qual_living_area_interaction`)  
- Neighborhood, house style, garage type, and basement finish  
- Size-related features such as garage area, total basement area, and number of bathrooms  

## Next Steps

- Explore advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to capture nonlinear relationships  
- Test additional hypotheses around neighborhood effects and garage characteristics  
- Incorporate corrections for multiple comparisons in hypothesis testing  

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required packages (e.g., pandas, seaborn, scipy)  
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce analysis and visualizations
